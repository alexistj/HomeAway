Description
HomeAway is an open source RCOS project designed to help college students in their search for off campus housing. This website will be an open review site like Yelp, for landlords and off campus housing locations. Students will be able to create an account post reviews for landlords and properties as well as additional information such as rent price, what utilities the space provides, etc. All reviews will be open for public view. The goal of this website is to encourage the local landlords to hold themselves to a higher standard and for students to be able to make the best educated choices on where they live.
